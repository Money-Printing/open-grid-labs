AI governance is the operating model that puts those principles into practice: the policies, roles, risk classifications, review processes, and controls ensuring every AI system actually meets them. Ethics sets the 'what' and 'why'; governance delivers the 'how' and 'who'."
	},
	{
		q: "What is an AI risk classification framework?",
		a: "It sorts AI systems into tiers—such as minimal, limited, high, and unacceptable risk—based on their potential impact. Each tier triggers proportionate controls: low-risk systems move quickly with light oversight, while high-risk systems require deeper review, documentation, human oversight, and monitoring. This mirrors regulations like the EU AI Act and keeps governance proportionate rather than blanket."

								Our client is a venture-backed AI company whose products are embedded in decisions that affect real people across enterprise customers. Leadership genuinely cared about doing AI responsibly and had published a set of principles—fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and safety. But principles on a webpage are not the same as control in practice, and as the company scaled past forty AI systems in production, the gap between intention and operation widened.

							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								Decisions about whether a model was safe to ship were made inconsistently, often by whoever happened to be in the room. There was no shared definition of which systems were high-risk, no standard review before launch, and no register of what AI was even running. Meanwhile, regulation—most visibly the EU AI Act—was moving from debate to enforcement, and enterprise buyers were demanding evidence of responsible-AI practices. The company didn't need more principles. It needed an AI governance operating model: the policies, roles, risk tiers, and review processes that make ethical AI an enforceable, repeatable system.
