Prompting and RAG are better for fast iteration and supplying fresh knowledge. In practice the three combine: RAG for knowledge, prompting for flexibility, fine-tuning for reliable behaviour at lower cost."

It needs much less GPU memory and produces small adapter files that are easy to store, swap, and serve—making custom models practical without the cost of full fine-tuning."

								Our client is a venture-backed AI company whose product performs a high-volume, specialised language task—structured extraction and classification—at the core of its workflow. To reach quality fast, they had built the feature on a top-tier frontier model accessed through an API. It worked well, and it got them to market. But the same model that made the product possible was now its biggest constraint.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								At more than six million task calls a month, the per-call API cost dominated their margins, every request left their environment, and they were entirely dependent on a single vendor's pricing, availability, and rate limits. Long, carefully engineered prompts had pushed quality as far as prompting could go, yet costs kept climbing with volume. The task itself was narrow and repetitive—exactly the kind of problem where a smaller, specialised model can match a general-purpose giant. The company needed to know: could fine-tuning a compact model match frontier quality on their task while slashing cost and giving them back control?

									Fine-tuning continues training a pre-trained model on a curated dataset of task-specific examples, adjusting its behaviour to specialise in tone, format, and domain reasoning. Unlike prompting, which steers a general model at runtime, fine-tuning bakes the desired behaviour into the model itself—often letting a much smaller, cheaper model match a large one on a narrow, well-defined task.
