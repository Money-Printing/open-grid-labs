	{
		q: "What is the difference between SHAP and LIME?",
		a: "SHAP uses game theory to assign each feature a consistent contribution to a prediction, giving globally coherent, audit-grade explanations at higher compute cost. LIME approximates the model locally with a simpler surrogate, making it faster but less globally consistent. Production systems often use both—LIME for fast individual checks and SHAP for rigorous analysis."

								Our client is a venture-backed AI company whose models make high-stakes decisions—risk scoring, eligibility, and prioritization—for enterprise customers in a regulated market. Their models were accurate, and accuracy had won them early business. But as they moved upmarket, every prospect's procurement, risk, and compliance teams began asking the same question their own data scientists could not always answer: why did the model decide that?

								The models were effective black boxes. When a customer challenged a decision, the team could show the output but not the reasoning.

The company didn't need more accurate models. They needed models that were transparent, auditable, and trustworthy—without sacrificing the performance that made them valuable.
