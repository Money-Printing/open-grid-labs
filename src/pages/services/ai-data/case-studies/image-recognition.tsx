								How Image Recognition Auto-Tagged Two Million Products Across 800 Categories
							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A fast-scaling marketplace had a two-million-item catalogue that was only as searchable as its tags — and those tags were applied manually by a team that couldn't keep pace with growth. OpenGridLabs built a multi-label image recognition system that classifies any product image across more than eight hundred categories at 97.4% label accuracy, turning a perpetual backlog into a fully automated, real-time capability.

								Our client runs a large online marketplace where discoverability is everything. Every item needs accurate, consistent category and attribute tags so buyers can filter, search, and find what they want. With more than two million items and thousands of new listings added daily, maintaining those tags manually had become a full-time function — and still the backlog grew. Inconsistent tagging between human reviewers made search quality uneven, and newly listed items sat untagged and undiscoverable until someone got to them.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The problem wasn't a lack of information — each item came with a product image that contained everything needed to classify it. The problem was that reading those images at scale required image recognition: teaching a model to look at a photograph and return the right set of category labels, as reliably and consistently as the best human tagger, but at machine speed.

									What Is Image Recognition?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Image recognition assigns one or more labels from a predefined set to an entire image — answering \"what is in this image?\" rather than \"where is each object?\". Multi-label recognition returns every applicable category at once, which matters when a real product image legitimately belongs to several classes simultaneously. It is typically solved with deep convolutional neural networks fine-tuned on domain-specific labelled data.
