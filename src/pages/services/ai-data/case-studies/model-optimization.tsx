const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is model optimization?",
		a: "Model optimization is the engineering discipline of making a trained machine learning model faster, smaller, and cheaper to run without meaningfully reducing its accuracy. Techniques include quantization (reducing numerical precision), pruning (removing redundant weights), and knowledge distillation (training a compact model to mimic a larger one). It bridges the gap between a model that works in research and one that scales in production."
	},
	{
		q: "What is the difference between quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation?",
		a: "Quantization reduces the numerical precision of model weights and activations — from 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers — cutting memory and compute with minimal accuracy loss. Pruning removes weights or components (neurons, attention heads, layers) that contribute little to accuracy, making the model structurally smaller. Knowledge distillation trains a small student model to reproduce the behaviour of a large teacher, inheriting its accuracy without its size."

								Our client is a venture-backed AI company whose products depend on serving predictions fast, cheaply, and at high volume. Their models had been trained to hit accuracy targets — and they did. The problem was everything that followed. At scale, inference costs consumed a disproportionate share of gross margin. Several models exceeded the latency budgets needed for real-time use cases. One needed to run in a constrained environment where the trained model simply couldn't fit. The accuracy was excellent; the economics and the physics were not.

							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The team's instinct was to buy more compute. OpenGridLabs' view was that the models themselves were the opportunity: a well-trained model almost always carries significant redundancy — weights that contribute little, numerical precision far beyond what accuracy requires, representations that could be absorbed by a smaller model. The right answer wasn't a bigger bill; it was model optimization — the engineering discipline of making existing models faster, smaller, and cheaper without starting over or sacrificing the accuracy it took months to achieve.

									Model optimization makes a trained model faster, smaller, and cheaper to run without meaningfully reducing its accuracy. Techniques include quantization (reducing numerical precision), pruning (removing redundant weights or structures), and knowledge distillation (training a compact student model to mimic a large teacher). Together they bridge the gap between a model that works in research and one that scales in production — on cloud, on-device, or in constrained deployments.

										<strong>The accuracy budget is non-negotiable — set it before you compress:</strong> Model optimization that silently degrades accuracy isn't a saving — it's a liability shipped to production.

Where quantization alone hit the cost target without touching the budget, no pruning was applied. Distillation was reserved for the one model where size constraints made it unavoidable.
