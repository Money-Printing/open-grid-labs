		q: "What is the difference between collaborative filtering and content-based filtering?",
		a: "Collaborative filtering recommends items based on what similar users liked—'people like you also enjoyed this'. Content-based filtering recommends items similar to ones the user has already engaged with, based on item attributes. Each has trade-offs: collaborative filtering struggles with brand-new users or items, while content-based filtering can lack variety. Hybrid recommenders combine both, plus popularity and freshness signals, to get the best of each."

								Our client is a venture-backed company with a sizeable catalogue—more than sixty thousand items—and a quarter of a million users browsing it. The homepage was a "top items" grid, the same list for everyone. It performed reasonably for new visitors who had little context, and badly for the people who came back: returning users saw the same handful of popular items over and over, even though their behaviour clearly showed different interests.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The long tail was the painful part. A vast majority of the catalogue almost never appeared on the homepage, even though users who eventually found those items often loved them. A flat, one-list-for-everyone surface couldn't connect interest with item: it favoured what was popular this week regardless of who was looking. What the company needed was a recommendation engine—a system that learns from each user's behaviour and the catalogue itself to predict what that specific user will most likely want next, and surface it.
