const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is time series forecasting?",
		a: "Time series forecasting predicts future values of a quantity that changes over time—demand, sales, traffic, or energy use—using its own history and related signals. Unlike standard regression, it explicitly accounts for trend, seasonality, autocorrelation, holidays, and external drivers. Common methods include ARIMA, exponential smoothing, Prophet, and gradient-boosted or deep-learning models adapted for sequential data."
	},
	{
		q: "Why can't you use ordinary cross-validation on time series data?",
		a: "Ordinary cross-validation shuffles data, which on a time series quietly leaks information from the future into the training set—producing models that look brilliant in testing and fail in production. Time series must be validated with time-aware schemes such as walk-forward (rolling-origin) validation, where every test fold is strictly after its training data, mirroring how the model will actually be used."

								Our client is a venture-backed company managing more than nine thousand SKUs and four years of daily history. Operations relied on a single rolling-average forecast applied uniformly across the catalogue—calculated in spreadsheets, refreshed manually, and blind to the way demand actually behaves over time. It treated a holiday-sensitive seasonal item the same way it treated a steady baseline product, and it had no concept of trend or uncertainty.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The consequences were predictable and expensive. Fast-moving, seasonal items stocked out at the worst possible times because the rolling average smoothed away the very peaks the team needed to plan for. Slow movers, meanwhile, kept piling up in warehouses because there was nothing in the forecast to recognise that demand had drifted down. Operations was either firefighting shortages or writing off excess. What the team needed was real time series forecasting—a system that respects how time works in the data: trend, seasonality, holidays, autocorrelation, and uncertainty—across thousands of SKUs at once.

										<strong>Honour the arrow of time, or the forecast lies:</strong> The most common way time series projects fail is by validating with ordinary cross-validation, which shuffles data and quietly leaks future information into training. Models that test brilliantly that way collapse in production.
