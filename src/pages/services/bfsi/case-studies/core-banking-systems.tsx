const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is the strangler-fig pattern in core banking migration?",
		a: "The strangler-fig pattern migrates a monolithic legacy system by building new components alongside it, routing increasing traffic to the new system as components are validated, and decommissioning the legacy system module by module. It avoids the big-bang replacement risk that makes full core banking replacements so dangerous."
	},
	{
		q: "How long does a core banking system migration take?",
		a: "A phased core banking migration for a mid-tier bank typically takes 18–36 months depending on the number of product lines, account volume, and regulatory complexity. The time is primarily driven by the length of parallel-run validation periods required to establish confidence in each module before cutover."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A mid-tier bank was running its core operations on a mainframe system installed in 1994 — inflexible, expensive to maintain, and staffed by a shrinking pool of COBOL engineers. Digital feature releases took quarters, not weeks. OpenGridLabs led a phased migration using the strangler-fig pattern: new microservices replacing mainframe modules one by one, running in parallel until confidence enabled cutover, with zero customer-visible downtime across the full 18-month programme.

								Our client is a mid-tier commercial bank with 2.4 million accounts across eight product lines — current accounts, savings, mortgages, personal loans, business accounts, credit cards, FX, and trade finance. Their core banking platform was a COBOL-based mainframe system installed in 1994, maintained by a team whose average age was 57 and for whom no succession pipeline existed. The system worked, but it was the bank's primary strategic constraint: time-to-market for new products was measured in quarters, regulatory reporting required manual extraction, and cloud integrations required expensive middleware.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								A 'big bang' replacement — shutting down the old system and launching the new one — was not an option for a regulated institution with 2.4 million customer accounts. OpenGridLabs designed and led a strangler-fig migration: a new cloud-native core banking platform deployed alongside the mainframe, with functionality migrated module by module, each running in parallel until the new system had proven itself at production load, enabling a controlled cutover without risk to customers or regulatory standing.

									What Is Core Banking Modernisation?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Core banking system modernisation is the process of replacing or incrementally re-platforming the central software system that handles a bank's fundamental operations — account management, transaction processing, ledger, product catalogue, and customer data. Modern approaches use the strangler-fig pattern to avoid big-bang risk: new components are built alongside the legacy system, traffic is gradually shifted, and the legacy system is decommissioned module by module as each replacement is proven.
