	},
	{
		title: "Document vault eliminates an entire contact category",
		desc: "Policy document requests are a high-volume, low-value contact centre category that exists entirely because customers cannot access documents themselves. A self-service document vault eliminates this category to near-zero, freeing contact centre capacity for contacts that require agent expertise."

	{
		title: "MTA self-service prevents mid-term lapse",
		desc: "A customer who moves house and cannot easily update their address on their home insurance policy either calls and waits (poor experience) or defers the update (creating a coverage risk). Self-service MTA makes keeping the policy accurate as easy as the transaction warrants — reducing mid-term lapse and improving risk data quality simultaneously."

const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is a mid-term adjustment (MTA) in insurance?",
		a: "A mid-term adjustment is a change made to an insurance policy during its term — between the start date and renewal date. Common MTAs include address changes, adding a named driver, changing the insured vehicle, modifying coverage levels, or changing payment details. MTAs typically result in a pro-rata additional or return premium and must be reflected in an endorsement to the policy."
	},
	{
		q: "How does a self-service portal affect insurance renewal retention?",
		a: "Self-service portals improve renewal retention primarily through proactive digital engagement — automated notifications at the right time before renewal, easy access to the renewal quote and comparison, and low-friction one-click renewal capability. They also improve retention indirectly by providing better ongoing customer experience, reducing the friction-driven dissatisfaction that makes customers receptive to switching."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A personal lines insurer with 800,000 policyholders was handling 3.2 million contact centre contacts per year — the majority of which were routine enquiries and transactions that should have been self-service. There was no digital channel for policyholders to view documents, make mid-term adjustments, or manage renewals without calling. OpenGridLabs built a comprehensive self-service portal that handled 68% of all transaction types digitally, reducing contact centre volume 39% and — critically — lifting renewal retention by 8 percentage points through proactive digital renewal management.

								Our client is a personal lines insurer with 800,000 policyholders across motor, home, and travel products. Their digital capability was limited to policy document download from a static portal — there was no self-service for any transaction. Every mid-term adjustment, every address change, every additional driver, every document request, and every renewal decision required a phone call to the contact centre. The contact centre was handling 3.2 million contacts per year, of which post-analysis showed 74% were transactions that a digital channel could have handled.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The renewal retention problem was the most commercially significant issue. The insurer was sending renewal notices by post 28 days before renewal and then waiting — customers who weren't proactively engaged frequently failed to renew because the friction of calling to renew was sufficient to trigger inertia. A digital renewal flow with email and push notification engagement, instant MTA capability, and one-click renewal had the potential to change the retention equation significantly.
