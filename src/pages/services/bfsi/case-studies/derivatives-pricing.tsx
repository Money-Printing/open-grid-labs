const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is SABR volatility surface calibration?",
		a: "SABR (Stochastic Alpha Beta Rho) is a stochastic volatility model widely used for options pricing that produces a consistent volatility smile across strikes and expiries. Calibration is the process of fitting the model's parameters to observed market option prices so that the model reproduces the market-implied volatility surface, enabling consistent pricing of instruments across the full strike and expiry space."
	},
	{
		q: "What are Greeks in derivatives pricing?",
		a: "Greeks are the sensitivities of a derivative's price to changes in its underlying risk factors: delta (sensitivity to underlying price), gamma (rate of change of delta), vega (sensitivity to implied volatility), theta (time decay), and rho (sensitivity to interest rates). They are used by derivatives desks to hedge positions and manage risk at the portfolio level."

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A financial services firm managing a derivatives portfolio of 40,000 instruments was valuing its book using end-of-day batch pricing — a process taking 4 hours nightly, with model inconsistencies between desks producing frequent valuation disputes with counterparties. OpenGridLabs built a real-time pricing engine: SABR volatility surface calibration, Black-Scholes and local vol models, Monte Carlo simulation for complex payoffs, and real-time Greeks calculation — reducing valuation disputes 74% and enabling intraday risk management for the first time.

								Our client operates a derivatives desk managing 40,000 instruments — equity and index options, interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, FX forwards, and a portfolio of structured products with complex payoffs. The pricing infrastructure was a combination of desk-specific spreadsheet models and a legacy batch pricing system running nightly. Different desks were using inconsistent volatility surface calibrations, producing different prices for the same underlying that resulted in valuation disputes with counterparties and internal inconsistencies in the risk aggregation.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The operational problems had a direct financial cost. Counterparty valuation disputes — where the firm's mid-market price and the counterparty's mid-market price differed by more than agreed tolerances — required escalation, manual reconciliation, and occasionally cash settlement of the difference. The disputes were costing the firm in both direct financial settlement and operational time. The underlying cause was inconsistent model calibration: each desk maintaining its own volatility surfaces, updated on different frequencies with different methodologies.
