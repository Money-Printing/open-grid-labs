const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is NAV in fund accounting?",
		a: "NAV (Net Asset Value) is the per-share or per-unit value of a fund — calculated as the total value of fund assets minus liabilities, divided by the number of shares or units outstanding. It is the price at which investors buy into and redeem from the fund. Accurate NAV calculation is a fundamental regulatory and investor protection requirement for authorised funds."
	},
	{
		q: "What is income equalisation in fund accounting?",
		a: "Income equalisation is an accounting mechanism used in funds to ensure that investors who join the fund mid-distribution period pay a fair price that accounts for the income accrued before they invested — preventing existing investors from having their income distribution diluted by new subscriptions. It requires the equalisation amount paid by each new investor to be tracked and returned to them as a return of capital in the first distribution."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								An asset manager running 12 UCITS and AIF funds was relying entirely on its third-party fund administrator for NAV calculations without maintaining shadow books — creating a dependency that left the firm unable to independently verify its NAVs or identify errors before they affected investors. OpenGridLabs built a shadow fund accounting system: automated shadow NAV calculation, daily reconciliation against the administrator's figures, and an income equalisation module — reducing fund accounting errors 89% and eliminating the late NAV publications that had generated FCA correspondence.

								Our client manages 12 authorised funds — eight UCITS and four AIFs — with total AUM of £8.6 billion. NAV calculation was entirely delegated to a third-party fund administrator, a standard arrangement in the industry. The problem was that the firm had no independent verification of the administrator's NAV figures — no shadow books, no independent calculation, and no systematic process for reconciling the administrator's output against the firm's own records. Errors in the administrator's NAV calculations had gone undetected for periods ranging from one day to four weeks before being identified through informal checks.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The FCA had corresponded with the firm following three instances of late or corrected NAV publications in an 18-month period. While the administrator bore primary responsibility for the errors, the regulator expected the fund manager to have adequate oversight controls — which the absence of shadow accounting demonstrated it did not. The shadow accounting project was simultaneously a risk management improvement and a regulatory response.
