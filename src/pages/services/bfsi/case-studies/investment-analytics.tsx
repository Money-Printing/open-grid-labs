Factor beta is the return from exposure to systematic risk premia (value, momentum, quality, size) that passive factor-based products also capture. Separating the two allows accurate assessment of active management value."

		q: "What is the Brinson attribution model?",

It is the most widely used return attribution framework in the investment management industry."

								An active manager reporting strong alpha to clients had never decomposed that performance into its factor components — skill versus systematic exposure to value, momentum, quality, and size. OpenGridLabs built a factor attribution and investment analytics platform that revealed the composition of returns in detail. The finding — that 71% of apparent alpha was factor beta — was uncomfortable but transformative: it led to genuine alpha measurement, honest client reporting, and a portfolio construction process grounded in evidence.

								Our client manages $12 billion across six equity strategies with a strong performance record — consistently beating their benchmarks over 3 and 5 year periods. Client reporting showed benchmark-relative performance and sector attribution using the Brinson-Hood-Beebower model. What it did not show was factor attribution: the decomposition of returns into exposure to systematic risk factors (value, momentum, quality, size, low volatility) versus genuine stock-selection alpha. The distinction mattered commercially — investors were paying active management fees for what was, in significant part, factor beta.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The motivation to build the analytics was not self-punishment — it was competitive necessity. Factor-based investing and smart beta products had made investors far more sophisticated about the components of active management returns. Institutional allocators were increasingly asking questions about factor exposure that the firm could not answer. OpenGridLabs built the investment analytics infrastructure to make factor attribution a core capability, and the findings, while initially uncomfortable, enabled the firm to make genuine improvements to its portfolio construction process.

									What Is Factor Attribution?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Factor attribution is the decomposition of portfolio returns into the contributions of systematic risk factors — value, momentum, quality, size, low volatility, and others — versus idiosyncratic alpha generated by individual security selection. A multi-factor attribution model allows investment managers to identify whether their returns are driven by skill (security selection) or by factor exposure (systematic risk premia that passive products also capture), providing a more honest assessment of active management value.
