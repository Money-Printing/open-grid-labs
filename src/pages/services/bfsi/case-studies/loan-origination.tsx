		title: "Automation improves credit quality by improving underwriter attention",
		desc: "An underwriter reviewing every application gives appropriate attention to none. An underwriter reviewing only the complex 30% gives their full expertise to those cases.

		title: "The decision model must be calibrated against the lender's own book",

const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is the difference between automated decisioning and credit scoring?",
		a: "Credit scoring produces a numerical risk score for a loan applicant. Automated decisioning uses that score — combined with policy rules, affordability assessments, and regulatory constraints — to make or recommend an approve/decline/refer decision. Credit scoring is one input to automated decisioning; it is not the same thing."
	},
	{
		q: "What is open banking affordability assessment?",
		a: "Open banking affordability assessment uses customer-consented access to their bank account transaction data to automatically identify income patterns, regular commitments, and expenditure categories, producing a more accurate and verifiable affordability picture than asking customers to self-declare income or manually submit bank statements."

								Our client is a retail lender processing 18,000 loan applications per month — personal loans, car finance, and debt consolidation — with average loan values between £3,000 and £25,000. The application process was digital at the front end: customers applied online and uploaded documents. The back end was manual: an underwriter reviewed each application, called the credit bureau, manually assessed affordability using bank statements, and sent an offer by email. Five business days was the average from application to offer, with a significant proportion taking 7–10 days.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								Digital lenders were offering sub-hour automated decisions on the same product set. The client was aware of the competitive pressure but concerned about the risk implications of automated decisioning — their underwriting team had genuine expertise and the manual process, for all its slowness, had produced a well-managed credit book. OpenGridLabs designed an automated system that didn't replace underwriter judgement but redirected it: automation handled the 70% of cases where the data was sufficient for a confident decision, and underwriters focused entirely on the 30% of cases where human assessment genuinely added value.

									A loan origination system (LOS) is the software platform that manages the end-to-end process of receiving, assessing, deciding, and documenting a loan application — from the customer's initial application through credit assessment, affordability verification, decisioning, offer generation, and documentation execution. A modern LOS integrates open banking data for affordability assessment, credit bureau APIs for credit history, and automated decisioning rules and ML scoring models to assess creditworthiness at speed.
