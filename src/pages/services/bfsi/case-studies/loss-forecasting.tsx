Together they form the total actuarial reserve needed above existing case reserves."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A commercial insurer's reserving function was relying on development triangle methods that, by construction, could only detect claim trends after those trends had materialised in settled claims data — creating a structural lag between when a trend emerged and when the reserve reflected it. OpenGridLabs built a predictive loss forecasting platform using ML models on granular claims data, catching an emerging liability claim trend 6 months before it appeared in the triangles — preventing an £8M reserve inadequacy.

								Our client is a commercial insurer with a substantial liability book — employer's liability, public liability, product liability, and motor fleet. The reserving process used standard actuarial development triangle methods, which are robust but inherently backward-looking — they estimate future development based on how historical claims have developed. When claims behaviour changes — a new legal trend, an emerging occupational disease, a legislative change affecting claim values — the triangles only detect it once enough claims have run through the system to change the development pattern.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The specific incident driving the engagement: a change in solicitor behaviour following a legislative amendment was driving higher average settlements in employer's liability claims. The actuarial team observed the trend in closed claims data after 18 months of gradually changing settlement values. By the time the triangles reflected it, the reserve was £8M inadequate. OpenGridLabs built a platform that could detect changes in claim characteristics from granular claims data earlier — catching the next trend before it became a reserve problem.
