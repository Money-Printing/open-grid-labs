	{
		title: "Quality monitoring at the source changes the incident response model",
		desc: "A bad tick that is detected at the data platform level — before it reaches any consuming application — is a data platform alert.

	{
		title: "Entitlement management unlocks the hidden cost reduction",
		desc: "Market data licensing is complex, multi-layered, and rarely reviewed holistically.

An entitlement management system provides that visibility; the cost reduction from renegotiation typically pays for the platform implementation rapidly."

const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is data normalisation in market data management?",
		a: "Data normalisation in market data is the process of mapping data from multiple vendors' proprietary schemas to a common internal data model — consistent field names, data types, timestamp formats, and identifier schemes (ISIN, FIGI, Bloomberg ticker). It allows consuming applications to access data from any vendor through a single consistent interface without vendor-specific integration code."
	},
	{
		q: "What is market data entitlement management?",
		a: "Market data entitlement management is the tracking and enforcement of the licences governing how a firm may use the market data it subscribes to — which applications can access which data elements, for which use cases, under which commercial terms. Vendor licence agreements typically restrict data usage to defined use cases and user counts; entitlement management ensures compliance and identifies over-purchasing."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A financial services firm was managing market data from six vendors with no centralised management layer — different applications connecting directly to different vendor feeds, no normalisation, no quality monitoring, and no consolidated view of entitlement costs. The bill from data vendors was £2.4M annually with no visibility into what was being used. OpenGridLabs built a centralised market data platform: normalisation, quality monitoring, entitlement management, and low-latency distribution — reducing data costs 41% and eliminating the data quality incidents that had been causing downstream pricing failures.

								Our client is a financial services firm with 140 applications consuming market data — pricing engines, risk systems, analytics platforms, trading infrastructure, and reporting tools. Market data came from six vendors: Bloomberg, Refinitiv, ICE, Markit, Morningstar, and a specialist fixed income data provider. Each vendor had independent connections to consuming applications, meaning the same data was frequently purchased multiple times under different entitlement agreements, and there was no consolidated view of data usage, quality, or cost.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The lack of a data management layer had created operational fragility: when a vendor experienced a data quality issue (wrong price, missing rate, stale tick), the error propagated silently into the consuming applications. Pricing failures caused by stale or incorrect market data required manual investigation to identify the source — a process that could take hours during which affected systems were operating on incorrect data. The £2.4M annual data bill had grown without review; an entitlement audit revealed significant redundancy.

									What Is Market Data Management?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Market data management is the centralised acquisition, normalisation, quality control, entitlement management, and distribution of financial market data — prices, rates, indices, reference data, and corporate actions — from multiple vendors to the consuming applications that depend on it. A market data platform provides a single source of truth for market data within a firm, eliminating redundant vendor connections, normalising data to a common format, monitoring for quality issues, and distributing data to consumers with appropriate latency for their use cases.
