								A commercial bank was operating on legacy SWIFT MT message formats, disconnected from instant payment rails, and experiencing settlement failure rates that generated significant operational costs. OpenGridLabs led the ISO 20022 migration — converting the bank's entire payment messaging infrastructure to the richer MX format — and implemented connectivity to Faster Payments and TARGET2 Instant, enabling round-the-clock real-time settlement for the first time.

								Our client is a commercial bank with £14 billion in annual settlement volume across domestic and international payment flows. The payment messaging infrastructure was based on legacy SWIFT MT message formats — MT103 for customer credit transfers, MT202 for interbank transfers — with connectivity to CHAPS for same-day high-value sterling payments but no direct connection to Faster Payments for instant sterling transfers or to TARGET2 Instant for euro instant payments. Settlement failures were running at 1.4% of transactions.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The SWIFT network's migration to ISO 20022 MX messages — mandatory by November 2025 — created the deadline, but the bank's leadership saw the migration as an opportunity rather than just a compliance task. ISO 20022 messages carry significantly richer data than MT messages — enabling straight-through reconciliation, richer remittance information, and the structured data required for SEPA instant and TARGET2 instant payment rails. The migration was designed to unlock capability, not just maintain compliance.

									ISO 20022 is an international standard for financial messaging that replaces legacy SWIFT MT formats with richer XML-based MX messages. It provides a common data dictionary for financial transactions, enabling significantly more structured and complete information in payment messages — including full originator and beneficiary details, purpose codes, and remittance information. The global financial infrastructure is migrating to ISO 20022 with mandatory adoption across SWIFT, TARGET2, and major payment systems.
