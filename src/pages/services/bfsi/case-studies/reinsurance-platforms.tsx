const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What is a bordereau in reinsurance?",
		a: "A bordereau is a detailed schedule of risks or claims submitted by a cedant insurer to its reinsurers under a proportional reinsurance arrangement, providing the information needed for reinsurers to verify their liabilities and calculate premium cessions or loss recoveries. Bordereaux are typically prepared monthly and must be provided in the format and within the timescale specified in the reinsurance treaty."
	},
	{
		q: "What is the difference between proportional and non-proportional reinsurance?",
		a: "Proportional reinsurance shares both premium and losses between the cedant and reinsurer in agreed proportions from the first dollar of loss. Non-proportional (excess-of-loss) reinsurance pays losses above a defined retention up to a defined limit, with the cedant retaining all losses below the threshold. Proportional requires regular bordereau cession; non-proportional requires recovery identification when losses breach the retention."

								How a Digital Reinsurance Platform Recovered £2.1M in Missed Reinsurance Recoveries
							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A specialty insurer with a complex reinsurance programme was managing its treaties and facultative placements through a combination of spreadsheets and email — monthly bordereau preparation taking 3 weeks, recovery calculations performed manually, and reinsurer reporting done by the finance team rather than from a system. An audit uncovered £2.1M in legitimate recoveries that had not been claimed. OpenGridLabs built a reinsurance management platform that automated bordereau processing, automated recovery identification, and reduced the bordereau cycle from 3 weeks to 4 days.

								Our client is a specialty insurer with a reinsurance programme covering property, casualty, and marine lines through a combination of proportional quota share, excess-of-loss treaties, and facultative placements with 23 reinsurers. The programme management was spreadsheet-based: treaty terms maintained in Excel, monthly bordereaux prepared by the reinsurance accounting team from claims system exports, and recoveries calculated manually against treaty terms. The team of four was spending the majority of each month on bordereau preparation.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The recovery audit that preceded the OpenGridLabs engagement identified £2.1M in legitimate recoveries that had not been claimed — primarily from excess-of-loss treaties where the manual recovery calculation had underestimated the recoverable amount or missed qualifying events entirely. The cause was not negligence but structural: manual recovery calculation against complex treaty terms, without systematic validation, produces systematic understatement. The audit finding was the commercial case for the platform investment.

								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									A reinsurance management platform manages the administrative and financial lifecycle of a cedant insurer's reinsurance programme — treaty terms and placement details, monthly bordereau preparation, cession calculations, recovery tracking, and reinsurer accounting. It integrates with the insurer's claims and policy systems to automatically identify claims that qualify for reinsurance recovery under treaty terms, calculate the recoverable amount, and track collection from reinsurers. Automation eliminates the manual calculation errors and process gaps that result in missed or understated recoveries.
