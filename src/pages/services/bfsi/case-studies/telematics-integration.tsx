		q: "What data does telematics collect for insurance?",
		a: "Insurance telematics typically collects: GPS location and route data, vehicle speed at regular intervals, acceleration events (harsh acceleration, harsh braking, harsh cornering), time-of-day classification, trip distance and duration, and — with smartphone-based telematics — phone distraction indicators. This raw data is processed into per-trip scores and rolling behaviour scores used for pricing and customer engagement."

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A motor insurer offering a telematics product was collecting driving data from 120,000 black box policies but pricing renewals based on traditional risk factors — age, vehicle, claims history — rather than the observed driving behaviour available in the telematics data. OpenGridLabs built a telematics data platform that processed 4.5 billion data points per month, built a driving behaviour score validated against subsequent claims, and integrated it into the renewal pricing engine — improving the loss ratio 11 points through superior risk selection.

								Our client had launched a black box telematics product three years earlier and grown it to 120,000 policyholders — primarily young drivers in the 17–25 segment attracted by the possibility of earning discounts for good driving. The telematics hardware and data transmission were functioning correctly: the insurer was receiving trip data including speed, acceleration, braking, cornering, and time-of-day for every journey. None of this data was being used in renewal pricing. Renewals were priced on traditional factors with a modest blanket telematics discount.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The consequence was predictable adverse selection: safer drivers — who had earned significant in-term discounts through their behaviour scores — were comparison shopping at renewal and finding that competitor prices, not adjusted for their actual driving behaviour, were competitive. The safest drivers were the most price-sensitive at renewal because they knew their risk was low. Meanwhile, the poorer drivers — who had received fewer or no in-term discounts — were stickier at renewal. The book was retaining the wrong mix.

									⚡ What Is Telematics Integration?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Telematics integration in insurance connects driving behaviour data — collected via black box hardware, smartphone app, or OBD port device — to the insurer's pricing, underwriting, and customer management systems. A telematics data platform processes raw trip data (GPS trace, accelerometer data, speed, time-of-day) into structured driving behaviour scores that can be used for risk pricing, customer engagement, and claims investigation. Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) uses telematics data to price insurance based on how much and how safely a customer drives.
