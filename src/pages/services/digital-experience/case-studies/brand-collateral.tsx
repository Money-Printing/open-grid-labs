const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What should a brand collateral suite include?",
		a: "A core brand collateral suite typically includes: a pitch/presentation deck, a one-pager or capabilities summary, a detailed brochure, an email signature, and event materials. More comprehensive suites add case study templates, data sheets, and co-branded partner materials. The specific items depend on the sales process and the touchpoints where prospects encounter the brand."
	},
	{
		q: "What is the difference between a one-pager and a brochure?",
		a: "A one-pager is a concise, typically A4 or US Letter document presenting the core value proposition, key benefits, and a clear call to action in a format designed for quick scanning or leaving at the end of a meeting. A brochure is a longer document — typically 4–12 pages — providing more detail, context, and credibility for later-stage consideration."

								A 30-person company had good salespeople and a confusing collateral situation: a pitch deck from 2022, a one-pager made by a freelancer, a brochure the founder designed himself, and email signatures that were each individual. Prospects encountered a different brand at every touchpoint. OpenGridLabs designed a complete, consistent collateral suite — every item expressing the same visual identity and the same core message — reducing visual fragmentation and shortening the average sales cycle 22%.

								Our client had a 30-person company with a sales team that had each assembled their own version of the brand. The pitch deck had been updated by three different people and showed it — inconsistent fonts, different slide layouts, and a narrative structure that varied between reps. The one-pager was from a year earlier and didn't reflect the current positioning. The company brochure had been designed before the recent rebrand and used the old logo.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The fragmentation had a real sales cost. Prospects who received multiple materials before or after a meeting encountered a different visual impression each time — undermining the consistent brand experience that builds confidence and trust over a long buying cycle. The sales team was also spending time creating and modifying materials rather than selling. A complete, cohesive collateral suite solved both problems: the brand became consistent and the team became faster.

									Brand collateral is the collection of physical and digital materials a company uses to communicate its brand and support its sales and marketing activities — pitch decks, brochures, one-pagers, data sheets, email signatures, event materials, and merchandise. Effective brand collateral applies the visual identity consistently, carries the core message coherently, and gives every team member the materials they need to represent the brand confidently at any touchpoint.
