The depth of each section should reflect how often it is used and how commonly it is misapplied."

		q: "How often should brand guidelines be updated?",

Guidelines that drift out of date become ignored; a defined update cadence keeps them authoritative."

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A 400-person company had a brand — a logo, some colours, a rough sense of who they were — but no authoritative document that specified how to apply any of it. The design team spent 30% of their time correcting materials produced by non-designers. Every new agency, freelancer, and partner started from scratch. OpenGridLabs produced brand guidelines that made the brand self-service: complete enough to answer almost any question without asking a designer.

								Our client had a 400-person organisation spread across four offices and a network of agency and freelance partners. The brand had been built over five years through an accumulation of individual decisions, and while there was a general visual direction that people recognised as 'the brand', there were no documented rules. A logo file existed on an internal drive that most people didn't know about. The brand colours were listed in a Slack message from 2021.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The cost was measurable. The design team tracked that 30% of their time was spent correcting materials produced by non-designers — presentations, social posts, event materials — that misused colours, applied the logo incorrectly, or used off-brand typefaces. Every new agency partner required a two-hour briefing that still produced a first round of work that needed significant correction. The brand existed; the instructions for using it did not.

									Brand guidelines (also called a brand book, brand manual, or brand standards) are the authoritative reference document that specifies how every element of a brand should be applied — the correct logo files and usage rules, the exact colour values, the typographic hierarchy, the imagery style, the tone of voice, and examples of correct and incorrect application. Good brand guidelines are specific enough to answer real questions and accessible enough to be used by non-designers.
