		q: "What is the difference between a brand refresh and a rebrand?",
		a: "A brand refresh evolves an existing identity — refining elements that have dated while preserving recognition cues that carry equity. A rebrand replaces the existing identity with a new one. A refresh is appropriate when there is genuine recognition equity to preserve; a rebrand is appropriate when the existing identity is a liability or when the company's positioning has changed fundamentally."
	},
	{
		q: "How do you know if a brand needs a refresh or a rebrand?",
		a: "If existing customers recognise and positively associate with the brand but the visual identity feels dated or performs poorly in digital contexts, a refresh is usually appropriate. If the brand has negative associations, is unrecognised in its category, or the company's positioning has changed significantly since the identity was created, a rebrand is likely necessary."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A 12-year-old company had built real brand equity — customers recognised and trusted the brand, the logo was widely known in the category, and the visual identity had genuine heritage value. It had also dated. The logo felt of its era. The colour palette was heavy by modern standards. The typography was a decade behind. OpenGridLabs conducted a surgical brand refresh — evolving every element intentionally rather than replacing it — lifting brand perception scores 42% while maintaining 91% existing customer recognition.

								Our client had a brand that had served them well for twelve years. The logo — a stylised mark with a bold wordmark — had become genuinely recognisable in their category. The company's colours and visual language were associated with them in their market. This was valuable equity that a rebrand — a clean-slate replacement — would have destroyed. The brief was not 'design us a new brand'. The brief was 'make our brand feel like it belongs in 2025, not 2013, without making our customers wonder if we've been acquired'.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The distinction between a rebrand and a brand refresh is not semantic. A rebrand replaces a visual identity. A brand refresh evolves it — resolving the specific elements that have dated while preserving the recognition cues that carry the equity. This requires a more careful, considered process than a rebrand: identifying which elements have equity worth preserving, which elements are simply dated, and how far each can be evolved before recognition is compromised.

									What Is a Brand Refresh?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									A brand refresh is an evolutionary update to an existing brand identity — refining the logo, modernising the colour palette, updating the typography, and strengthening the overall visual system — without replacing the fundamental elements that customers recognise. It differs from a rebrand, which creates a new identity from scratch. A brand refresh preserves brand equity while ensuring the visual identity feels contemporary and performs across modern digital contexts.
