		q: "How does packaging design affect retail placement?",
		a: "Retail buyers evaluate packaging on three criteria: shelf visibility (does it stand out in the competitive set?), brand communication (does it accurately represent the product and justify the price point?), and shopability (is the hierarchy clear enough for a shopper to understand the product in 3 seconds?). Packaging that scores well on all three increases the likelihood of placement and of premium fixture position."

								A consumer brand with a genuinely superior product was losing at the shelf — shoppers were picking up the competitor's packaging, not theirs. A retail buyer had twice declined to stock the product, citing packaging that 'didn't communicate the product's quality'. OpenGridLabs redesigned the packaging from a retail and brand strategy perspective: shelf presence, hierarchy, material, and unboxing experience — producing packaging that made the product's quality visible before it was tried.

								Our client made a premium consumer product that outperformed its competitors in blind product tests. On the shelf, it underperformed. The packaging was functional — it protected the product and listed the required information — but it communicated nothing about the product's quality or the brand's character. The colour was undistinguished. The hierarchy of information was unclear. The typography was generic. On a shelf next to a competitor with stronger visual identity, it was invisible.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								Two retail buyer meetings had ended without placement. Both buyers cited the packaging in their rejections: 'the product seems good but the packaging doesn't reflect it'. One buyer said directly: 'I need my customers to understand why this costs more than the alternatives — your packaging doesn't help me make that case.' The redesign had a specific brief: make the product's quality visible, make the price premium defensible, and make the shelf presence strong enough to justify premium fixture placement.

									What Is Package Design?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Package design is the creation of a product's physical and visual container — encompassing structural design (the shape and material of the packaging), graphic design (typography, colour, imagery, and hierarchy on the surface), and the unboxing experience (how the packaging opens and what it communicates in sequence). Good package design communicates brand positioning and product quality at the shelf, provides the right information at the right moment, and creates an experience of the brand that begins before the product is used.
