const FAQS = [
	{
		q: "What makes an effective event poster?",
		a: "An effective event poster prioritises visual impact over information density. The design should earn attention at a distance — through bold typography, strong colour, or a striking graphic concept — before delivering the event details. Information hierarchy should direct the eye from the attention-earning element to the essential details (event name, date, location, URL) in order of importance."
	},
	{
		q: "What resolution should a poster be designed at?",
		a: "Print posters should be designed at 300dpi at the final output size, or as vector artwork scalable to any size. Large format posters (A0 and above) are commonly accepted at 100–150dpi at final size due to their viewing distance. Digital poster formats should be designed at 72–96dpi in RGB at the correct pixel dimensions for their display context."

							</h1>

							<p className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-light text-foreground/80 leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
								A company running an annual conference had been producing promotional posters that communicated the event details clearly and attracted nobody's attention. The design was functional, professional, and forgettable. OpenGridLabs redesigned the conference poster campaign around a single principle: a poster must earn attention before it earns engagement. Bold typography, a strong visual concept, and a cohesive series increased registration 67% year-on-year.

								Our client runs an annual technology conference that had been growing in quality but not in registration numbers. The event was excellent once people were there; getting them to register was the problem. Post-event surveys had flagged 'didn't hear about it' as the top reason non-attendees gave — which, for a company with a strong industry presence, pointed to a communication problem rather than an awareness problem. The promotional materials, including the poster campaign, were not creating attention.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The prior year's posters were typical professional conference design: the logo at the top, the event date and location in the middle, a list of headline speakers at the bottom, and a website URL below that. It contained all the necessary information and generated none of the visual impact needed to make someone stop and look. OpenGridLabs designed from the opposite brief: earn attention first, communicate information second.

									What Is Poster Design?
								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Poster design is the discipline of communicating a message on a single printed or digital surface in a way that earns attention from a passing audience. Unlike brochures or websites, a poster has one chance to stop someone who is not looking for it. Effective poster design prioritises visual impact — typically through bold typography, strong imagery, or a striking graphic concept — over information density, using hierarchy to direct the eye to the most important element first.
