								Our client was four weeks from launching a new product area they had been building for six months. The team was confident — internal demos had gone well, the engineering was solid, and the visual design had received positive feedback in design reviews. OpenGridLabs asked to run usability testing before launch. The request was met with some resistance: the team felt they knew their product.
							</p>
							<p className="text-lg md:text-xl font-light leading-relaxed text-foreground/80 dark:text-foreground/70">
								The first round of five moderated sessions identified eighteen critical issues — interaction patterns that consistently caused failure across participants. Fourteen were fixed in the three weeks before launch. The four that remained were known and understood. The launch activation rate was three times the company's historical average for new product areas — a result the team attributed directly to the pre-launch testing programme.

								</h3>
								<p className="text-base md:text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
									Usability testing places real users in front of a product with specific task scenarios and observes how they interact, where they struggle, and where they succeed. Moderated testing involves a researcher guiding and questioning; unmoderated testing collects data at scale without a facilitator. The System Usability Scale (SUS) provides a standardised score for comparing usability over time. Five users in a well-designed moderated study can surface 80% of a product's critical issues.
